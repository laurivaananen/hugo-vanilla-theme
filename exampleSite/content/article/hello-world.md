**What programming language should I learn first?**

Every beginner programmer has asked this question at least once.

And for a good reason. The programming languages you learn decides what kind of **jobs you can get**.

There are multiple metrics you have to take into consideration when choosing what language to learn.

In this article, you'll be finding out using **science** what are the **best** programming languages for different cases.

{{< info-card >}}
### Things to consider when choosing a language

* How high is the **average salary**?

* How many job openings there are compared to other languages?

* Is it enjoyable to use?

## What variables affect choosing a language

The biggest reason why people want to learn to code is to get a job.

Other reasons can be:

* Building a business

* For own projects

* Just for fun

An even more important question is *What do you want to make with programming?*.

Most common projects are:

* Websites

* Mobile applications

* Desktop applications

* Games

* Machine learning

* Robotics

Each of these fields requires a different set of tools to do most effectively.

Thankfully many languages can be used in different fields. These are called universal languages.

## Choosing the right programming language for getting a job in 2020

I used two of the most important metrics when researching for the best programming language:

* **Number of job openings**

  How many jobs there are currently for this programming language.

  If you are looking for a career in software engineering pay close attention to this one.

* **Average salary**

  I noticed a **shockingly huge** disparity between the salary of different languages.

  If you are not aware of this metric you might get **severely** underpaid.

I collected the data from the [2020 Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#top-paying-technologies) and by manually searching for jobs in the [Stack Overflow job board](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs).

You can instantly notice **three languages** that are way above anything else.

**Java**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.

## The best language for web development

Should you learn JavaScript or TypeScript?

JavaScript has over three times the job openings compared to TypeScript but TypeScript has a **$4000** higher average salary.

Another interesting metric to look at is [how much do developers love using a language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted). In this graph TypeScript is **the second most loved language**.

HTML and CSS will always be mandatory but I would go with TypeScript as the current trends show that it's only getting more popular.

For back-end development, Java, JavaScript (TypeScript), and Python can be used.

Out of these languages TypeScript and Python are **extremely** liked by the community while JavaScript and Java not so much.

## Do not learn these languages

Looking at the graph there are some languages to not choose as your first to learn.

These fall into two categories:

* **Overhyped languages**

  These are languages that the community loves to use but see very little adaptation in terms of jobs

* **Old languages**

  Some languages used to be very popular but are not popular anymore.

Avoid these languages as your first language:

* Rust

* PHP

* Perl

* Haskell

You will hear a lot of apologists for these languages but try to avoid them.

You might be intrigued by the high salaries of some languages, but remember to take popularity into consideration.
